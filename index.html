        <p>I'm sure, wherever your father is, she loves you very much. I'll buy you a hundred George Michaels that you can teach to drive! Let's see some bananas and nuts! ♪♪ It's The Final Countdown ♪♪ Let the great experiment begin! I know, I just call her Annabelle cause she's shaped like a…she's the belle of the ball! </p>
        <p>There are very few intelligent, attractive and straight men in this town. Well, that certainly leaves me out. That coat costs more than your house! Oh, COME ON! </p>

				<p>I mean, it's one banana, Michael. What could it cost, ten dollars? It's OUR nausea. She keeps saying that God is going to show me a sign. The… something of my ways. I don't criticize you! And if you're worried about criticism, sometimes a diet is the best defense. </p>
				<p>It's sort of like going from prime rib to… I don't know… weird brother of prime rib. Absolutely. And we're going to be here every day. I don't care if it takes from now till the end of Shrimpfest. She calls it a Mayonegg. Ann, you need to decide whether you want a man or a boy. I know how I'd answer. Do the right thing here. String this blind girl along so that dad doesn't have to pay his debt to society. Hey, it was one night of wild passion! And yet you didn't notice her body? I like to look in the mirror.</p>
				<p>Everybody dance… NOW. There's a girl in my soup! So you take your mom to work every day? Bummer. Moms are such a pain in the ass, huh? It's, like, die already! Let's make Ann the backup, okay? Very good way to think about her, as a backup. </p>

          <p>Special order for anybody that’s comin‘ for me, I’m too good with these words, Oh you tried it’s so childish calling my name on the world stage, No sleepin‘ in the streets, And if a boy nuh like, Pray the fakes get exposed, Ex-girl she the female version of me, All the rappers that you vouch for need to get out of the house more they washed up, I can’t stay here no more and I can’t sleep on the floor</p>

          <p>This that OvO that SZN this that new Toronto, You know how that should go, I’m not new to this, Tell that nigga back back, Blowin‘ up my niggas really need the whole thing, Fuck goin’ online that ain’t part of my day, Buncha‘ niggas chasing after all these woman they don’t even know, I’m convinced that my calls are being recorded, Just let me go just let me go let bring it home to you</p>

					<p>Putting cars on the lease, I really hate getting aggressive on this phone with you momma, Now we in the basement and we workin‘ on the phone, This been where you find me at, Well he’ll understand, They need the whole thing, I only text her man I never call, Maybe one day but even one day with us is a time of a life, Still in Miami</p>
					<p>Y’all don’t wanna hear me say it’s a go, I’m not new to this, I mean I’m back on this again I’m here again, Never get sloppy drunk but alcohol is problem solving, Tell that nigga back back, I been on a mission haven’t left the condo, It’s our year (aw yeah) Aw yeah, I need some company, Yeah I’m leaving yeah I’m leaving I’m leaving I’m gone</p>
					<p>Feel like we one and the same our relationship changed, You still down? You still down? You still down? Its like - I’m the one they wanna be momma, You know how that should go, And I’m sure that she’s a angel but she don’t want this life, I saw potential in you from the go, If me and Future hadn’t made it with this rappin’, Winter here already but somehowI’m heatin‘ up, I give a fuck about old boy</p>
